This chapter showcases PyNetDesignPro's capabilities through practical, hands-on scenarios. 
Whether you're setting up a seismic network, analyzing magnitude sensitivity or location accuracy, or visualizing results, these examples provide step-by-step guidance to help you effectively use PyNetDesignPro. 
Designed to be both educational and practical, this chapter bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. 
Explore these examples to unlock the full potential of PyNetDesignPro in your projects.

Examples cover 10 test monitoring network geometries for both homogeneous and layered velocity models:

1. Simple station geometry with 3 surface stations in the form of a triangle, from :cite:t:`Hallo2012`
2. Simple station geometry with 4 surface stations in the form of a triangle with 1 station in the center
3. Simple DAS geometry with 1 vertical borehole
4. Combined geometry with 4 surface stations and DAS in a vertical borehole
5. Geometry with a DAS cable in an inclined borehole
6. Geometry with a DAS cable in a twice inclined borehole
7. Geometry with a DAS cable in a deep vertical borehole and noise constant along the borehole
8. Geometry with a DAS cable in a deep vertical borehole and noise decreasing with depth
9. Geometry with a single station above a DAS cable in a deep vertical borehole and noise constant along the borehole
10. Geometry with a single station above a DAS cable in a deep vertical borehole and noise decreasing with depth

Besides, there are also an example that showcase the use of raytracing.
